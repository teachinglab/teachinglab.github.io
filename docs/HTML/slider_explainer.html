      <br>
      <br>
     <p style = 'text-align:left;margin-left:1em;'>It depends. Unfortunately, different calculations have different computations, tools, and issues involved so data is not always up to date to the last second! With Teaching Lab&rsquo;s current data stack, all tools can be guaranteed to be updated within at least the last 24 hours (business days). Below is a comprehensive list of tools, and the timeline on which they update.

      <li>Qualtrics dashboards - potentially up to a 60-minute delay on responses appearing in dashboards.</li>
      <li>Teaching Lab shiny dashboards - potentially up to a 60-minute delay on responses appearing.</li>
      <li>Data trackers - these update daily at 6 AM EST, so there will be 6 am + time since then delay on updating</li>
      <li>Reports - Currently (SY23-24 November 21) the only report is the ongoing report, which has a 60-minute potential delay on data appearing.</li>

      <p>We ask participants to report the extent to which they agree/disagree with Likert statements surrounding Equitable Mindsets on a scale from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree).&nbsp;</p><p>Equitable Mindsets - Section 4a</p><p>Self-Reported CRSE - Section 6a</p><p>These statements are grouped into the following categories (non participant facing): <span style="color:rgb(51, 51, 51);">Recognition of Race &amp; Culture, High Expectations, and Growth Mindsets</span></p><p><span style="color:rgb(51, 51, 51);">(Sentiment Score) We ‘score’ the responses to these statements using a weighted scale, where the ideal response is ‘strongly agree, 5’, and overall higher scores correspond to holding equitable mindsets &nbsp; :</span></p><ul><li>Strongly agree - 5&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;score: 1.0</li><li>Agree - 4&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; score: 0.75</li><li>Neither Agree Nor Disagree - 3&nbsp; &nbsp; 	score: 0.5</li><li>Disagree - 2&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;score: 0.25</li><li>Strongly Disagree - 1&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; score: 0.0</li></ul><p><span style="color:rgb(51, 51, 51);">For scoring purposes, in the case of </span><span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0);">reverse coded </span>questions, where we would ideally expect participants to select “strongly disagree - 1”, we treat responses of 1 as 5, 2 as 4, 3 as 3, 4 as 2, and 5 as 1. Therefore, on a reverse coded question, if a participant selected strongly disagree - 1, they receive a score of 1, whereas if they selected agree - 4, they receive a score of 0.25.&nbsp;</p><p>Once the weighted scale is applied, we calculate an average score for each mindset statement. For example, a statement with 5 responses of Agree, Strongly Agree, Agree, Neither Agree Nor Disagree, and Strongly Agree, the following score would be reflected:&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align:center;">score = 0.75 + 1.0 + 0.75 + 0.5 + 1.05 =0.80 , or 80%</p><p>Finally, we can wrap up these mindset statements by their category using an <strong>average of the statement scores in the category</strong>. As an example:&nbsp;</p><div><table><tbody><tr><td>Recognition of Race and Culture</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Overall</strong></td><td>66.14%</td></tr><tr><td><span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0);">I am color blind when it comes to my teaching - I don’t think of my students in terms of their race or ethnicity.</span></td><td>54.67%</td></tr><tr><td><span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0);">The gap in the achievement among students of different races is about poverty, not race.</span></td><td>62.31%</td></tr><tr><td>I think about my own background and experiences and how those affect my instruction.</td><td>81.44%</td></tr></tbody></table></div>

      <p>Classroom observations are scored as the average of the total questions per individual that qualifies as a positive indicator - or put another way, the % positive indicators per individual.

      <b style = 'font-size:20px;'>How do we score course assessments?</b>
      <div class = "left-align-text" style = "text-align:left;padding-left: 1.1em;">
        <p>
          Course assessments questions can prompt anywhere from 1-3 correct answers in a question. Using the question “Which of the following statements are true about the principles behind the Instructional Routines? Select all that apply.” from the “<em>Math Cycle of Inquiry - Instructional Routines</em>” as an example, the following should demonstrate the full range of possible scores (images from the course assessments dashboard which can be viewed here).
        </p>
        <img src="./images/data_overview/course_assessments3.png" alt="course assessments" width="608" height="435" style = "position:inherit;">
        <p>
          In this breakdown of the % selected per question, the correct answers are displayed with green text. If an individual participant were to select both the correct answers response to this question they would receive 100% on that question, if they were to select only one of the correct answers they would receive 50%, and if they selected no correct answers they would receive 0%. There are no penalties for incorrect answers.

        <p>
          Ultimately, all that data gets rolled up into the numbers in the following chart, the overall % correct. This shows the average score that each participant received on all questions the first time that they took the quiz (Before/Pre) and the second time (After/Post).
