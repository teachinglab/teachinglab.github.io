## **Beyond the Basics: What Teachers Really Seek from Professional Learning**

### **What Do Teachers Want From Professional Learning?**

Have you ever attended a professional learning (PL) session and walked away feeling disconnected? Across the country, there needs to be more clarity between what is commonly offered to teachers and what they really want from PL. A school's success depends on designing successful, meaningful, innovative PL that kindles teachers' passion for continuous improvement. 

\
Naturally, teachers want to invest their time and effort in activities that are relevant, practical, and directly applicable to their classrooms. In this blog post, we provide a snapshot of PL opportunities some of our partners are eager to invest their time and effort in according to Teaching Lab survey data.

Over the 2022-2023 school year, 1600 teachers indicated their preferences for upcoming professional learning opportunities. Participants could pick their top two activities from a predetermined list given by Teaching Lab that aligns with our service offerings and focus. The responses indicated that the top priorities for teachers included supporting diverse student learners (52%), implementing evidence-based instructional practices (42%), and unpacking curriculum (28%) as their highest priority. In addition, nearly 20% of respondents expressed a desire for more PL opportunities that focus on pedagogy from a culturally responsive perspective and on developing effective professional communities with their peers. 

### **Do Novice and Experienced Teachers Want the Same Things from PL?**

Understanding the evolving priorities of teachers at different experience levels is crucial for designing targeted and effective PL opportunities to address educators' targeted needs and interests throughout their careers.

During the 2022-2023 school year, teachers (76) with less than one year of teaching experience expressed a high level of interest in targeted areas for PL, including:

-   Supporting diverse learners (i.e., English Learners, students with disabilities, and students with unfinished learning) at almost 60%.

-   Implementing effective, evidence-based instructional practices at slightly over 50%.

-   Unpacking curriculum at 33%.

-   Teaching from a culturally responsive lens at 21%.

-   Developing effective professional communities with peers at 13%.

Teachers (626) with 1-10 years of teaching experience articulated their desire for PL that supports:

1.  Diverse learners at 54%.

2.  Implementing effective, evidenced-based instructional practices at 42%.

3.  Unpacking curriculum at 29%.

4.  Teaching from a culturally responsive lens at 22%.

5.  Developing effective professional communities with peers at 17%.

In contrast, educators (546) with 11-20 years of teaching experience articulated their desire for PL in slightly different proportions:

6.  Supporting diverse learners at 50%.

7.  Implementing effective, evidenced-based instructional practices at 41%.

8.  Unpacking curriculum at 27%.

9.  Developing effective professional communities with peers at 20%.

10. Teaching from a culturally responsive lens at 18%.

It is important to note that teachers across experience levels also expressed an interest in receiving regular and personalized coaching from instructional experts and becoming facilitators for peer professional learning.

### **Cultural Responsiveness and Professional Communities**

There was a 3% distinction between novice and experienced teachers concerning the emphasis on teaching from a culturally responsive lens. As teaching experience increased, this discrepancy expanded to an 8% difference in how novice and experienced teachers prioritized “developing effective professional communities with peers.” This pattern may suggest that novice teachers may place a higher emphasis on cultural responsiveness and collaboration, while more experienced teachers may have already developed proficiency in these areas. 

### **Consistent Emphasis on Supporting Diverse Learners**

Supporting diverse learners is a consistent priority for novice and more experienced teachers. This may highlight the ongoing need for PL that addresses the diverse needs of students- including English Learners, students with disabilities, and those with unfinished learning. 

### **Evidence-Based Instructional Practices Across Experience Levels**

Implementing effective, evidence-based instructional practices is a shared priority among teachers regardless of experience levels. This underscores the importance of a strong pedagogical foundation and the desire for ongoing training in evidence-based teaching methods. 

### **Shifts in Professional Learning Priorities with Experience**

The data may indicate a shift in PL priorities based on teaching experience. Teachers with less than one year of experience may prioritize a broad range of topics, strongly emphasizing supporting diverse learners. In contrast, those with 11-20 years of experience may maintain a focus on supporting diverse learners but show a decreased emphasis on unpacking curriculum and teaching from a culturally responsive lens. 

### **Varied Emphases on Unpacking Curriculum**

Again, while unpacking curriculum is a priority for both groups, it is relatively more emphasized by teachers with less than one year of experience. This may suggest a particular interest or perceived need for novice educators to delve into curriculum content and structure.

### **Interest in Coaching and Peer Learning Roles**

It is important to note that teachers across experience levels also expressed a shared interest in receiving regular and personalized coaching from a content area expert. Additionally, there is interest in “becoming a facilitator for peer professional learning”-- possibly indicating a desire for active roles in professional development within learning communities. 

### **Do Teachers of Different Racial Identities Want the Same Things from PL?**

The chart below offers insights into the PL priorities of a diverse sample of teachers- including those who identify as Asian (44), Black/African American (279), Native American or Indian (28), and White (1,185). The six foremost priorities identified were:

-   Supporting diverse learners (such as English Learners, students with disabilities, and those with unfinished learning).

-   Implementing effective, evidence-based instructional practices.

-   Unpacking curriculum.

-   Teaching from a culturally responsive lens.

-   Developing effective professional communities with peers.

-   Becoming a facilitator for peer professional learning. 

These priorities help provide a snapshot of the shared focus areas among teachers from various racial backgrounds.

### **Challenges in Culturally Responsive Teaching** 

The scores for teaching from a culturally responsive lens indicate a collective challenge across racial groups. Native American or Indian teachers scored notably lower, suggesting potential opportunities for PL in this area. The data highlights the need for increased efforts to integrate cultural responsiveness into teaching practices (Cantrell et. al, 2022). 

High-Quality PL May Help Address: 

-   Collaboration & Cultural Exchange

-   Curriculum Integration

-   Effective Communication 

-   Implicit Bias Awareness

-   Inclusive Classrooms 

### **Consistency in Evidenced-Based Instructional Practices**

Across all racial groups, there was a relatively close alignment in scores for evidence-based instructional practices. While there are slight variations, the similarity may suggest a shared commitment to utilizing evidence-based approaches concerning pedagogy—cutting across racial and cultural backgrounds (Loveless, 2023).  

High-Quality PL May Help Enhance Opportunities For: 

-   Coaching

-   Collaborative Learning Communities

-   Evidence-Based Practices

-   Feedback & Reflections 

-   Data-Informed Decision Making

-   Standards Alignment

-   Technology Integration

### **Difference in Developing Professional Communities**

The scores for developing effective professional communities with peers vary among racial groups. Native American or Indian teachers scored the highest, possibly indicating a strong inclination toward collaborative PL. White teachers scored slightly lower, while Asian and Black teachers scored lower still. These differences may signify varying levels of emphasis or engagement in building professional communities (Simmie, 2023).

High-Quality PL May Help Foster: 

-   Collaborative Planning 

-   Diversity & Inclusion

-   Recognition & Celebrations

-   Sense of Shared Purpose

-   Structured Opportunities for Collaboration

-   Team building 

### **Disparities in Supporting Diverse Learners**

The difference in scores among racial groups in supporting diverse learners may highlight a potential gap in understanding or addressing the needs of diverse student populations. In this particular sample, Asian teachers scored notably higher than Black and Native American or Indian teachers—indicating potential differences in educational approaches (Jones et. al, 2019).

High-Quality PL May Help Address: 

-   Access & Equity

-   Cultural Competencies 

-   Data-Driven Decision-Making

-   Differentiated Instruction Strategies

-   English Learners Needs

-   Parent & Community Engagement

-   Social-Emotional Learning (SEL) Supports

### **Roles as Facilitators for Peer PL**

The data on becoming a facilitator for peer PL reveals a clear distinction among racial groups. Native American or Indian teachers score the highest, suggesting a potential leadership role in fostering peer learning. Black teachers also scored relatively high, while Asian and White teachers scored lower. This underscores the importance of recognizing and supporting teachers in leadership roles for peer professional development, particularly among Native American or Indian teachers (Canaran, 2023). 

High-Quality PL May Help Foster: 

-   Content Knowledge and Expertise

-   Educational Best Practices

-   Inclusive and Safe Spaces for Collaborative Learning

-   Mentorship & Support Networks

-   Support for Diverse Learning Styles

-   Understanding Andragogy

### **Variation in Unpacking Curriculum**

The scores for unpacking curriculum reveal noteworthy differences among teachers of varying racial backgrounds. Black teachers scored higher than others, suggesting a potential emphasis on thorough examination and understanding of curriculum content. Asian and White teachers ranked unpacking curricula slightly lower than their counterparts. But this may be indicative of an area for further exploration (Creech, 2023)

High-Quality PL May Help Address: 

-   Assessment & Evaluation Strategies

-   Collaborative Curriculum Planning

-   Comprehension of Standards & Learning Objectives

-   Equity & Inclusion

-   Feedback and Reflection Opportunities

-   Utilizing Data to Help Inform Instruction

### **Do Administrators Want the Same PL Opportunities as Teachers?**

At the close of SY23, 39% of administrators (55) ranked “unpacking curriculum” as one of their top priorities. These same administrators also deemed “implementing evidence-based practices” (29%) and “developing effective professional communities with peers” (25%) important. The dataset may have a narrow scope, but it is still important to note that there may be a level of misalignment between the priorities of administrators and teachers. While there is overlap in some areas (i.e., implementing evidence-based instructional practices), the percentages indicate differences in emphasis. Administrators prioritized “unpacking curriculum” and “implementing evidence-based instructional practices” more than “developing effective professional communities with peers”. On the other hand, teachers prioritized “supporting diverse learners” more than “implementing evidence-based instructional practices” and “unpacking curriculum.”

This misalignment suggests that administrators may be placing greater emphasis on curriculum planning and instructional methods, while teachers prioritize addressing the needs of diverse learners. To enhance alignment, administrators and teachers may consider continuing to engage in open communication and collaborative decision-making processes to: 1) Help identify shared priorities and 2) Enhance strategies for effectively addressing the needs of both groups.
