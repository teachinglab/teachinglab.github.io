      <b style = 'font-size:20px;'>How often does data update?</b>
      <br>
     <p style = 'text-align:left;'>It depends. Unfortunately, different calculations have different computations, tools, and issues involved so data is not always up to date to the last second! With Teaching Lab&rsquo;s current data stack, all tools can be guaranteed to be updated within at least the last 24 hours (business days). Below is a comprehensive list of tools, and the timeline on which they update.
     </p>
      <ol style = 'text-align:left;'>
      <li>Qualtrics dashboards - potentially up to a 15-minute delay on responses appearing in dashboards.</li>
      <li>Teaching Lab shiny dashboards - potentially up to a 15-minute delay on responses appearing.</li>
      <li>Data trackers - these update daily at 6 AM EST, so there will be 6 am + time since then delay on updating</li>
      <li>Reports - Currently (SY23-24 November 21) the only report is the ongoing report, which has a 15-minute potential delay on data appearing.</li>
