title: "Trademark Policy"

::: {.callout-note appearance="simple"}
This policy is adapted directly from the WordPress Foundation's [trademark policy](https://wordpressfoundation.org/trademark-policy/) for the WordPress and WordCamp names and logos. We admire the job that WordPress has done building a thriving open source community while at the same time making possible a wide variety of WordPress related businesses. We hope that this policy will help us do the same for Quarto.
