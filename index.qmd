## FAQ

-   How do I navigate the data hub?

    -   Check out [this Zoom Clip](https://us02web.zoom.us/clips/share/8-SmBuAp23k0bKP0fnL59kyCcG-IzMSYEAslNCHTKjVzdTjthA6MSvmTGKO2GSm3DrR2vPP6.gFkJWCOhvBE0OO3Y){target="_blank"} for a full breakdown! Generally the content is organized by the navigation bar above, but also feel free to use the search bar. The key pages to know about are dashboards, trackers, and reports, which are all listed in the navigation bar.

-   How do I know what dashboard I want?

    -   That depends on what kind of data you are looking for, the *most likely answer* is the "Ongoing Report" on the "Reports" page, since it has a broad overview of all L&R data, but there are more detailed, custom dashboards for other purposes organized by the Guskey Framework which drives all of our research, on the "Dashboards" Page, with detailed descriptions and tutorials describing their individual use cases.

-   What is on here?

    -   Here's a short list: L&R Dashboards, Reports, and Trackers. Additionally our blog, data dives, and much more L&R informative content under the resources page - check that out!

-   How often does the data update?

    -   All custom dashboards should update within 10-15 minutes, except for the course assessments dashboard since they are highly customized. Trackers should update on an hourly, or daily basis, the FY24-25 Coaching Data Collection Tracker updates *hourly*. For specific details read [here](https://datahub.teachinglab.org/On_the_data.html).

-   Where is data from previous years?
